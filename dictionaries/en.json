Neck circumference</h2><p class=\"font-light text-sm\">Wrap the flexible metric tape around your neck, leaving one finger between your neck and the tape for comfort. Write down the result.</p><h2>2. Chest circumference</h2><p class=\"font-light text-sm\">Grasp the fullest part of your chest, placing the measuring tape under your arms and over your shoulder blades. Make sure the tape runs horizontally. Write down the result.</p>        <h2>3. Waist circumference</h2><p class=\"font-light text-sm\">Find the narrowest part of your waist and wrap it with a metric tape. Make sure the tape runs horizontally. Write down the result.</p><h2>4. Hip circumference</h2><p class=\"font-light text-sm\">Grasp the fullest part of your hips by passing the measuring tape across your buttocks. Make sure the tape runs horizontally. Write down the result.</p><h2>5. Sleeve length</h2><p class=\"font-light text-sm\">Measure the sleeve length from shoulder to wrist. Find the bone in your shoulder that sticks out when you lift your arm and measure from there to your wrist. Write down the result.</p><h2>6. Length of dress or skirt</h2><p class=\"font-light text-sm\">Measure from the waist to the desired length of the dress or skirt. Please note that length may vary depending on style and preference. Write down the result.</p><h2>How to use the measurement results::</h2><p class=\"font-light text-sm\">Compare your measurements to our size chart, which you can find on each product page. Choose the size that best matches your measurements. If your measurements are between sizes, we recommend choosing a larger size for comfort.</p><p>If you have questions or concerns regarding measurements or size selection, please contact us. We are always ready to help!</p><h3>Tips for measuring:</h3><ul class=\"list-disc pl-6\"><li class=\"text-sm mt-2\">It is best to measure yourself in underwear or clothes that fit your body.</li><li class=\"text-sm mt-2\">Do not tighten the metric tape too much. It should lie flat, but not compress the body.</li><li class=\"text-sm mt-2\">It is best to measure yourself with the help of another person to get the most accurate results.</li><li class=\"text-sm mt-2\">If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, we recommend choosing a size that will match your measurements after giving birth or finishing breastfeeding.</li><li class=\"text-sm mt-2\">If you are ordering clothing for a special event such as a wedding or prom, we recommend measuring yourself in advance so that you have enough time to adjust the size if necessary.</li></ul>"
